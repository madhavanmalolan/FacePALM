TwitterClusterServer
This starts a simple REST server which can be used to query information about a cluster.

Usage:
$ java ClusterServer hdfs://hdfs_uri PORT_NUMBER

PORT_NUMBER is the port number on which the server has to listen.
hdfs://hdfs_uri is the uri to the common access HDFS. 


The REST server responds to two requests:
/query
This has to be a POST request with a payload containing a single integer the cluster id number.
It responds with a json of the following format:
{
	id: cluster_id,
	words: [
	 { word : "hello" , score : 0.623 }, {word : "world" , score : 0.2262 }]
}
which is the corresponding centroid of the cluster.

/update
This query instructs the server to update its cluster source to a new cluster on hdfs. this has to be called before any other query. This maybe called to update the cluster source to a newly clustered data source.
This takes as input a payload of data in json with 3 objects :
dictionary_file,frequency_file,centroid_file which are respectively the 3 inputs needed for cluster centroid data.
